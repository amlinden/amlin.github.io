            <!-- <h2>HERMES (High-frequency Emergency and Rural Multimedia Exchange System)</h2> -->
            <p>We are excited that this project has been selected as a promising idea by Mozilla's   
              <a href="https://wirelesschallenge.mozilla.org">Wireless Innovation for a Networked Society (WINS) Challenge</a> and look forward to developing it more over the coming months.</p>
            <h1>The goal</h1> 
            <p>
              To create reliable and affordable communications in rural and remote places where access to Internet is difficult or non-existent due to isolation or disaster – places generally extremely limited in their back-haul options, as it is too expensive and slow to install terrestrial links or rent satellite connectivity as well as with regards to access to energy.
              </p>
              <h1>The idea</h1> 
            <p>
              Design and create modular autonomous network infrastructure for use in very remote areas or in post-disaster situations, that assumes no availability of electricity or other communications access. The solution will be easily installable by non-experts, reasonably portable, and fully-contained, allowing for both local and global communications. The overall goal is to facilitate robust local communications and information with limited but useful communications with the rest of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The solution, which integrates GSM and a new HF backhaul technology, can provide connectivity to places struck be natural disasters or populations living in remote areas. As the system does not rely on cables or satellites, it could also be used as a backup system for primary communications systems.
              To ensure coverage and ease of use, the primary user-facing technology will be 2G GSM. This is the most widespread digital communication technology in the world and is also minimally battery intensive, meaning users will be able to connect devices they likely already own to the network for longer, assuming no grid power is available.
              The HF backhaul system was designed with and implemented in Amazon communities in the Brazilian state of Acre as part of the Fonias Juruá project (of which Rafael Diniz is also project lead), which has shown that it is possible to teach local communities to set up HF systems and keep them running for many years.
              The local content cache design is in ongoing development with a number of communities and developers and will likely be a mix of things like <a href="https://racheloffline.org/">https://racheloffline.org/</a> and <a href="http://solarspell.org//">http://solarspell.org/</a>  mixed with software and content specific to the project.
